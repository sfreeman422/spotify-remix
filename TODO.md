# TODO:

- Serialize API calls when adding to playlist
- Decouple subscribing and refreshing the playlist such that when a user is following the playlist in spotify and is in our DB, we let them know they are subscribed. We should not be waiting on the refresh to occur.
- Make sure subscribing to a playlist works properly
- Get all songs in liked playlist recursively
- Better styling
