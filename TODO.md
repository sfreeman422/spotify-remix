# TODO:

- Fix bad UX for clicking the button - maybe redirect to history after a user has subscribed.
- See if you can show a different name in the playlist rather than screenname since some ppl are just numbers
- Consider grouping by genre/bpm or some other similarity.
- Fix subbed playlists not showing up
- Add ability to unsubscribe from a playlist
- Consider unsubscribing users who no longer follow a given playlist
- Consider a way to easily clean up orphaned playlists
- Better styling
- Performance profiling
